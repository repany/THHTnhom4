hGraph
======
An example of a web site using the hGraph library with random health data.

This example needs to have access to a JSON encoded file containing health metrics, any local http server can be used to enable the page to load correctly.

You can create a local http server by issuing the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" from the hGraph root directory, you can then access the example by pointing your browser to "http://localhost:8000/examples/basic/".
